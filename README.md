# Raspby Hub

Raspby Hub is a homemade project designed to provide utilities and tools for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts and developers. This project simplifies the setup, management, and deployment of various services by combining essential tools like Vagrant, Docker, and artifact storage.

## Features

- **Provisioned Virtual Machines**: Seamlessly set up and manage virtual environments using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), tailored for Raspberry Pi utilities and testing.
- **Dockerized Services**: Prebuilt and customizable Docker images for deploying lightweight, containerized applications.
- **Artifact Storage**: Centralized storage for managing and versioning artifacts generated by your projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using Raspby Hub:

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaximeJumelle/raspby-hub.git
cd raspby-hub
```

## Docker Images

The `docker/` folder contains many Docker images configurations to allow you to easily build and run applications safely.

### Run a Raspby Image

If you want to run a container with a Raspby images, there are a few things to consider first. Raspberry Pi peripherals, such as GPIO pins, are typically accessed through specific libraries (e.g., `RPi.GPIO`, `gpiozero`) that need access to the Raspberry Pi's device files. You then **have to pass the `/dev` and `/sys` directories** (or any other specific devices, such an USB device like a camera) to the container.

It is also advised to use the `--privileged ` flag to allow the container access to hardware. Here is an example of a `docker run` command you can execute on the Raspberry Pi.

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v /sys:/sys \
  -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
  --network=host \
  raspby-hello
```

> Note that Raspby Docker images can only be executed on a Raspberry Pi !
